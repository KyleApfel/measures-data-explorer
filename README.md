# Measures Data Explorer ðŸ”Ž

This is a Measures Data filter tool built in NextJS as a fun tool using the public measures data. Used the standard NextJS build tool.

## Getting Started

Install the deps

```bash
npm install
# or 
yar n
```

Running the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Healthcheck can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/health](http://localhost:3000/api/health). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/health.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
